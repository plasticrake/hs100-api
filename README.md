TPLink HS100/HS105/HS110 WiFi Smart Plug API

## Supported Devices

| Model | Type | deviceType | Support |
|-------|------|------------|---------|
| HS100, HS105, HS110 | Plugs | IOT.SMARTPLUGSWITCH | Good |
| HS200 | Switch | | Good |
| LB100, LB110, LB120 | Bulb | IOT.SMARTBULB | Limited |

I only own HS100, HS105 and HS110 (plugs), so Switch and Bulb support is difficult for me to test. I'd gladly accept pull requests to add features or equipment donations ([amazon wishlist](http://a.co/bw0EfsB)) so I can do my own development!


## Example
```javascript
const Hs100Api = require('hs100-api');

const client = new Hs100Api.Client();
const plug = client.getPlug({host: '10.0.1.2'});
plug.getInfo().then(console.log);
plug.setPowerState(true);

// Look for plugs, log to console, and turn them on
client.startDiscovery().on('plug-new', (plug) => {
  plug.getInfo().then(console.log);
  plug.setPowerState(true);
});
```

## API
The API is currently not stable and there may be breaking changes.

### Client

#### new Client(options)
Returns a Client object.
```javascript
options: {
  [address]
  [, port]
  [, broadcast = '255.255.255.255']
  [, discoveryInterval = 10000]
  [, discoveryTimeout = 0]
  [, offlineTolerance = 3]
  [, deviceTypes = ['IOT.SMARTPLUGSWITCH']]
  [, debug = false]
}
```

#### startDiscovery([plugs])
Sends a discovery packet to the broadcast address every `discoveryInterval`(ms). Stops discovery after `discoveryTimeout`(ms) if it is greater than 0. An array of addresses can be specified to query directly. If `deviceTypes` is specified only matching devices are found. Returns Client that emits `plug-new` when a response from a new plug is received and `plug-online` for known plugs. If a known plug has not been heard from after `offlineTolerance` number of discovery attempts then emits `plug-offline`.

#### stopDiscovery
Stops discovery process.

#### getPlug(options)
Returns a Plug object.
```javascript
options: { host [, port = 9999] [, timeout = 0] [, inUseThreshold = 0] }
```

### Plug
#### `startPolling(interval)`
Polls the plug every `interval`. Returns plug that emits `power-on`/`power-off` based on the relay state and `in-use`/`not-in-use` when the device is drawing more than power than the `inUseThreshold` if it supports power monitoring. These events may be emitted during any query of the device, not only when using `startPolling`.
#### `getInfo` _(promise)_
Get all plug info. Same as calling getSysInfo, getCloudInfo, getConsumption, getScheduleNextAction.
#### `getSysInfo` _(promise)_
Get general plug info.
#### `getCloudInfo` _(promise)_
Get TP-Link Cloud information.
#### `getConsumption` _(promise)_
Get power consumption data for HS110 plugs.
#### `getPowerState` _(promise)_
Returns true if plug is on.
#### `setPowerState(value)` _(promise)_
Turns the plug on or off.
#### `getScheduleNextAction` _(promise)_
#### `getScheduleRules` _(promise)_
#### `getAwayRules` _(promise)_
#### `getTimerRules` _(promise)_
#### `getTime` _(promise)_
#### `getTimeZone` _(promise)_
#### `getScanInfo([refresh = false] [, timeout = 17])` _(promise)_
Get list of networks.
#### getModel _(promise)_
